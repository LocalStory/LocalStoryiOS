# Local Story

Welcome to Local Story!  Local Story is an iOS app created to discover anonymous local stories that are around you.

Our goal was to create an annoymous environment where users can easily do a micro post about their current situation.  We intentionally made it so that you can only post at your current location.  However, you can easily find stories across the city, state, or even world.  Discover local stories now!
